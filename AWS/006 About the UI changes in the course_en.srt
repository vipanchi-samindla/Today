00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,410
Hi, so I just won't talk to you

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,830
about the UI changes that you may see

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,460
between my videos and AWS.

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,810
So just to explain things to you,

5
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,930
AWS is doing a huge transition of their interface

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,990
to a new guidelines for design.

7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,860
And so in that regards, sometimes the UI will look new

8
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,920
and this is what I call a new type of UI

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,190
and it looks like pretty square and so on,

10
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,410
but sometimes you will have the old kind of UIs,

11
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,690
which looks like this.

12
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,741
And so AWS is doing a transition for all their services,

13
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:32,770
of all their UIs and it's not all at the same time.

14
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,210
It happens over one year or two years

15
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,484
and it's still happening today.

16
00:00:36,484 --> 00:00:38,821
So my goal is obviously to have videos

17
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:42,980
as updated as possible, but it is literally impossible

18
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,140
to keep up with all the changes

19
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,530
until they're done with them.

20
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,750
So what I'm doing is that I try my best to keep my videos

21
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,648
up to date if they are breaking changes,

22
00:00:50,648 --> 00:00:52,974
but if I believe that the changes are minor enough

23
00:00:52,974 --> 00:00:55,311
that you can find your way around the console,

24
00:00:55,311 --> 00:00:58,860
I will not update the video just yet, but trust me,

25
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,850
I do listen to feedback

26
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,840
and whenever a video is outdated,

27
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,450
I will go ahead and update it.

28
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,283
Okay.

29
00:01:05,283 --> 00:01:07,650
Another thing you can do is that if you really are lost,

30
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,590
you can switch a toggle in most of the services

31
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,170
that have a new experience and switch back to the old UI.

32
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,280
If you do switch back to the old UI like here

33
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,398
as you can see, you will see the old UI sometimes

34
00:01:18,398 --> 00:01:21,590
like you see in my videos, but really I just wanted

35
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,600
to give you a little warning just to explain to you

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,750
the course is not outdated.

37
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,470
It is my passion and my duty to make sure

38
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,870
that you pass your exam and learn a lot in this course

39
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:33,330
and so trust me, I am monitoring every single day

40
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,900
for updates and changes that are breaking my course

41
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,040
and if they do break my course,

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,270
I promise that I will update my videos, but please, please,

43
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,990
please forgive me in advance

44
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,460
if the video doesn't look as updated as the UI in AWS,

45
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,070
it is very difficult right now

46
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,350
to keep up with their changes.

47
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,250
So thank you so much and I wish you a very happy learning.
