1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,880
OK, so welcome into the AWS management console, I'm just going to give you a quick tour to see

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,360
how everything works in there.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,410
So first of all, on the top right corner, you have the region.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,360
And right now I am in us-east-1 which corresponds to U.S., Northern Virginia.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,950
But as we can see, we have a lot of regions around the world where we can start using AWS. So my

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,330
general guideline is to choose a region that is geographically close to you.

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,790
So because I'm in Europe, maybe a good place to start for me would be Europe, Ireland, eu-west-1.

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,200
But if you're in another continent, if in Asia, Asia-Pacific, maybe choose one of those.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,120
If you're in Africa and you have a specific region in Capetown, if you're in the U.S., you have four

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,930
regions and so on.

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,970
And so the idea is that it doesn't have to be a region in your own country, but something that's close

12
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,690
to you so that you have the least amount of latency while using AWS and following along with me.

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,830
OK, so I'm in Ireland. Now with the console, you can look at all the services that are here in the

14
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:04,830
page right here, but you can also access other services on the top left corner in the bar and you get

15
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,930
access to a list of all the services available in AWS. As you can see, that's a lot of services.

16
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,470
But don't worry, we'll learn the most important ones in this course.

17
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,930
Another really good trick that you have is the search box.

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,660
So I really like the new search bar.

19
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,490
So if you type IAM, for example, this is going to take you straight into the IAM service. And on top

20
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,270
of your service.

21
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,810
Some features of AMI: groups, rolls, policies and users.

22
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,960
But this also shows you documentation and marketplace results if you wanted to.

23
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,110
So let's have a look at IAM so I'm going to open I am in a new tab.

24
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,160
So I'm in IAM, I am and as you can see here on the top right corner, it says global.

25
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,630
That's because IAM, as we'll see in this course, is a global service and it does not require region

26
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,110
selection.

27
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,060
But if I go back and choose another service, for example, EC2.

28
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,730
Then I will have the fact that on the top right corner, it says Ireland so EC2 is what's called

29
00:01:58,730 --> 00:01:59,720
a regional service.

30
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,510
That means that if you operate EC2 in another region, for example, I switch from Ireland to, say,

31
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,740
Frankfurt, then I'm going to have a completely new different sets of resources.

32
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,060
So resources are scoped.

33
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,830
Your region for most services in AWS and you will know if it's a regional service or not by looking

34
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,940
at the top right corner.

35
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,090
But most services in AWS are regional.

36
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:26,480
The other thing you can look at is the global infrastructure web page on AWS, so you just Google it.

37
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:32,990
And what you can do is that if you click on AWS regional services, then you get access to which services

38
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,790
are available within reach, which region.

39
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,550
So for U.S. East Ohio, for example, I have the list of all the services available to me.

40
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,630
So if in this course you are operating in the region, for example, you're in Cape Town in Africa and

41
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:49,490
you don't have access to a specific service, I'm teaching this course then switch to another region

42
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:55,310
by using the top right corner to one that's different, that will have maybe access to the service we're

43
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:55,900
talking about.

44
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,500
This is very important because I want to be able to follow along, but not every service is offered

45
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,250
in every region.

46
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,150
And that's something you have to know when you're using AWS.

47
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,820
OK, so that's it for this lecture.

48
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,470
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
