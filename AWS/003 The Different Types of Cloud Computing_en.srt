1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,540
As we will see in this course,

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,500
there are different types of Cloud Computing,

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,380
and it is important for us to be able to recognize them.

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:11,350
The first one is called Infrastructure as a Service or IaaS.

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,760
This is to provide the building blocks for cloud IT.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,180
With this IaaS, we're going to provide networking,

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,870
computers and data storage space in its raw form.

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,650
And using these building blocks deals building Legos,

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,690
we're going to be given a very high level of flexibility,

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,770
and we can easily understand

11
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,600
how we can migrate from traditional

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,262
on-premises IT to the cloud.

13
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:36,890
That is the first service we'll see in this course,

14
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,790
which is going to be easy too.

15
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,570
Then we're going to get Platform as a Service.

16
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,370
In this, we're going to remove the need

17
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,090
for your organization to manage

18
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,150
the underlying infrastructure.

19
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,250
And you can just focus on the deployment

20
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,400
and management of your applications.

21
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,280
And then one step even further,

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,423
is Software as a Service or SAS.

23
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:58,060
This is a completed product

24
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,020
that is going to be run and managed by the service provider.

25
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,950
So if you want to compare all these things,

26
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,650
well, let's take an example.

27
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,280
On-premise is you're going to manage everything.

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,220
So your applications, your data,

29
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,020
your runtime, your middleware,

30
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,000
the operating system, virtualization, servers,

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,130
storage and networking.

32
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,580
And that's a lot.

33
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,580
With IaaS, Infrastructure as a Service,

34
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,380
we're going to manage the application,

35
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,160
the data, the runtime, the middleware,

36
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,620
and the OS, but all the virtualization,

37
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,520
servers, storage and networking,

38
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,460
are going to be managed by others.

39
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,610
And in our case, AWS.

40
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,860
With Platform as a Service,

41
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,540
we manage even less.

42
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,600
So everything from the runtime

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,350
to the networking is managed by AWS.

44
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,970
And the only thing we care about

45
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,860
when we use a Platform as a Service

46
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,720
is our application and our data.

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,610
And finally, well if you're using Software as a Service,

48
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,960
everything is going to be managed by AWS.

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,540
So how does it translate?

50
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,270
Well, with IaaS, we can use Amazon EC2 on AWS.

51
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,440
We have other services such as Google Cloud,

52
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,400
Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, and Linode,

53
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,550
which will provide us

54
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,910
Cloud Computing Infrastructure as a Service.

55
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,743
Platform as a Service

56
00:02:10,743 --> 00:02:13,350
also exists on AWS with Elastic Beanstalk

57
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,920
and we'll see all these services obviously in this course.

58
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,800
And outside of AWS,

59
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,120
we have Heroku, Google App Engine and Windows Azure.

60
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,300
For Software as a Service,

61
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,120
we'll also have this on AWS,

62
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,230
that represents many services of AWS for example,

63
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,220
recognition when we want to do some Machine Learning,

64
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,660
but we've been using it as well

65
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,560
in the real world with Google Apps such as Gmail,

66
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,430
or Dropbox or zoom for your meetings.

67
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,260
So the clouds have different flavors.

68
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,650
But one thing is common

69
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,905
is that the pricing is very different from what you know.

70
00:02:44,905 --> 00:02:47,730
AWS has three pricing fundamentals

71
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,330
and it will follow the pay-as-you-go pricing model.

72
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,310
So for the compute, and that represents various services,

73
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,143
where you're going to pay

74
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:56,270
for the exact compute time.

75
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,990
For the storage, we're going to pay

76
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,817
for the exact amount of data stored in the cloud.

77
00:03:00,817 --> 00:03:03,720
And for the networking, we're going to only pay

78
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,760
when the data leaves the cloud.

79
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,090
Any data that goes into the cloud is free.

80
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,350
And this solves the expensive issue of traditional IT.

81
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,520
Because now we only pay exactly what we need

82
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,430
and so we have huge cost savings ahead of us.

83
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,830
So that's it for this lecture.

84
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:20,663
In the next lecture,

85
00:03:20,663 --> 00:03:22,713
we'll be having a deeper dive on AWS
