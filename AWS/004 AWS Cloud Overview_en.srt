1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,930
Now let's look at the history

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,790
of the AWS cloud.

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,780
So it was launched in 2002

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,240
internally at amazon.com.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,100
Because they realized

6
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,940
that the IT departments could be externalized.

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,150
So their Amazon infrastructure was one

8
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,050
of their core strength

9
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,017
and they said, "you know what

10
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:18,203
"maybe we can do IT for someone else,

11
00:00:18,203 --> 00:00:19,700
"for other people."

12
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,240
So they launched their first offering publicly

13
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,294
which was SQS in 2004.

14
00:00:24,294 --> 00:00:26,940
In 2006, they expanded their offering

15
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,430
and they relaunched with the availability of

16
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,604
SQS, S3, and EC2.

17
00:00:31,604 --> 00:00:33,840
Don't worry, we'll see all these services

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,970
in this course.

19
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,437
Then they expanded and said, "you know what?

20
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:38,487
"We don't have to be just in America.

21
00:00:38,487 --> 00:00:39,760
"We could be in Europe."

22
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,940
And then fast forward to today,

23
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,500
we have so many applications that used to run

24
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,795
or are still running on AWS,

25
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:50,195
such as Dropbox, Netflix, Airbnb, or even the NASA.

26
00:00:50,195 --> 00:00:53,750
Now, let's look at where AWS is today.

27
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,410
If we look at the Gartner magic quadrants,

28
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,198
which sort of ranks the cloud providers,

29
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:02,180
as we can see AWS is on the top right corner,

30
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,480
which is a leader.

31
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,400
It's able to execute really well.

32
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,490
And it has a really great completeness of vision.

33
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,960
It is followed closely by Microsoft and Google.

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,830
But still

35
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:16,830
in 2019, AWS had $35 billion in annual revenue,

36
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,780
which is huge and accounted for 47%

37
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,480
of the market in 2019.

38
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,250
With Microsoft being second with 22%.

39
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,137
So by learning AWS

40
00:01:27,137 --> 00:01:29,554
you are learning a tool that is widely used.

41
00:01:29,554 --> 00:01:32,460
It is a pioneer and leader

42
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,470
of the AWS Cloud Markets for the ninth consecutive year.

43
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,450
And it has over 1 million active users.

44
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,330
So what can you build on AWS?

45
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,740
Well, pretty much everything.

46
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,570
AWS will enable you to build sophisticated

47
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,200
and scalable applications

48
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,530
and they are applicable to diverse set of industries.

49
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,230
Every company has a use case for the cloud.

50
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,420
So Netflix, McDonald's, 21st century Fox, Activision,

51
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,970
they're all using the cloud.

52
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,900
And use cases can include just

53
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,181
transferring your enterprise IT

54
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:02,980
or using the cloud as a backup and storage,

55
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,460
or doing some big data analytics.

56
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,550
You can also host a website

57
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,710
or create a backend

58
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,330
for your mobile and your social applications.

59
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,500
Or you could have your entire

60
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,370
gaming servers running on the clouds.

61
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,500
The applications are endless.

62
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,910
Now AWS is global.

63
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,880
And this is where we are going to learn a bit more specifics

64
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,010
about how it works.

65
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,900
So we have AWS regions,

66
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,377
we have availability zones, data centers,

67
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:30,790
edge locations, and points of presence.

68
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,015
And all of these can be represented on the map right here.

69
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:35,420
So let's go on this website

70
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,770
to have a quick look at it.

71
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,940
So this is a cool map,

72
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,060
because on this website

73
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,460
we can see how AWS is global.

74
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,440
So if I click on it,

75
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,273
I can, you know,

76
00:02:44,273 --> 00:02:46,530
scroll the world and see what is happening.

77
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,200
So we can see that AWS has multiple regions

78
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,260
and they're in orange and they're all around the world.

79
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,410
For example, Paris, in Spain, in Ohio,

80
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,150
in Sao Paulo, Cape Town, Mumbai, and everywhere else.

81
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,580
So AWS truly is a global service.

82
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,503
On top of it,

83
00:03:04,503 --> 00:03:07,610
each region are going to be connected through the network.

84
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,010
So these are the network reconnecting the regions

85
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,882
and this is a private network of AWS.

86
00:03:11,882 --> 00:03:14,729
And then within each region, for example,

87
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:18,720
if I really scroll into the Cape Town region,

88
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,000
we can see that we have blue dots.

89
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,633
And each blue dots will be availability zones

90
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:25,550
that we'll be describing in the next slide.

91
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,440
So as we can see,

92
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,860
what I want to get you out of this,

93
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,610
is that the AWS is truly is global.

94
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,370
And we can leverage the infrastructure of a cloud

95
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,704
provider to make ourselves, our application global.

96
00:03:35,704 --> 00:03:39,160
The first important concept in AWS are regions.

97
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,920
So regions are all around the world

98
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,030
and we saw it on the map from before

99
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,490
the regions have a name,

100
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,439
it could be us-east-1, eu-west-3,

101
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,690
and we can see the mapping of the name of the region

102
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:54,820
to their code on the console that we'll see in a minute.

103
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,970
Now a region, what is it?

104
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:56,930
It's truly,

105
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,240
well, it's going to be a cluster of data centers.

106
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,502
So many different data centers.

107
00:04:00,502 --> 00:04:02,430
Look at it (indistinct) for example,

108
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,770
Ohio or Singapore or Sydney or Tokyo.

109
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,630
When we use AWS services,

110
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,880
most services are going to be linked

111
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,970
and scoped to a specific region.

112
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,650
That means that if we use a service

113
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,690
in one region and we try to use it in another region,

114
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,160
it will be like a new time of using the service.

115
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,700
Now, a question that may come up

116
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,810
in the exam is how do you choose an AWS region?

117
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,840
So say you're launching a new application.

118
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,830
Where should you do it?

119
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,550
Should you do it in America, in Europe

120
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,634
in South America, or in Australia?

121
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:35,560
Well, the answer is, of course it depends.

122
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,790
But let's look at some factors that may impact your choice

123
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,410
of a AWS region.

124
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,160
The first one is compliance.

125
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,650
So sometimes governments want the data to be local

126
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,020
to the country you're deploying the application in.

127
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,970
For example, France,

128
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,640
data in France may have to stay

129
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,570
in France and therefore you should launch your application

130
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,153
in the French region.

131
00:04:56,153 --> 00:04:59,380
Then, there is also a concept of latency.

132
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,140
So if most of your users are going to be in America,

133
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,590
it makes a lot of sense to

134
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,620
deploy your application in America,

135
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,470
close to your users,

136
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,870
because they will have a reduced latency.

137
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,040
If you deploy your application

138
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,800
in Australia and your users are in America,

139
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,530
they will have a lot of lag at using your application.

140
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,410
Then, also not all regions have all services.

141
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,243
Okay?

142
00:05:20,243 --> 00:05:22,120
Some regions do not have services.

143
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,420
And so obviously if you're

144
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,650
leveraging a service with your application,

145
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,483
you need to make sure

146
00:05:26,483 --> 00:05:28,040
that the region you're deploying into

147
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,970
is available and does have that service.

148
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,650
And finally,

149
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,483
pricing.

150
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:36,670
So, pricing does vary from region to region

151
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,750
and you need to consult the applicant,

152
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,120
the services, pricing, (indistinct)

153
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,030
to see what the differences are between the regions.

154
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,210
But this could be obviously a factor that could

155
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,640
impact your deployment

156
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,023
of an application into a specific region.

157
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,820
Now, availability zones are what actually

158
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,640
are going into the region.

159
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,960
So each region will have many availability zones.

160
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,260
Usually three, the minimum is two, and the max is six.

161
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,429
But, really the usual is three.

162
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:05,430
So, let's take the Sydney region as an example.

163
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,440
The senior region code is ap-southeast-2.

164
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,310
So, we can have two,

165
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,950
have three availability zones in

166
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,898
Sydney, ap-southeast-2a,

167
00:06:12,898 --> 00:06:14,617
ap-southeast-2b,

168
00:06:14,617 --> 00:06:16,493
and ap-southeast-2c.

169
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,170
Now, each of these availability zones

170
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,110
are going to be one or more,

171
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,130
just create data centers that will have redundant power,

172
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,350
networking, and connectivity.

173
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,544
That means that in

174
00:06:28,544 --> 00:06:29,680
southeast-2a,

175
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,320
I can have two data centers maybe, as well two

176
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,040
in 2b and two in 2c.

177
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,660
But it could be one, it could be three, it could be four.

178
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,100
We don't really know.

179
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,933
AWS doesn't tell us that.

180
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:38,920
But, what we know

181
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,910
is that these availability zones are

182
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,440
separate from each other

183
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,372
so that they will be isolated from disasters.

184
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:48,770
So, if something happens to ap-southeast-2a,

185
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,580
we know that it is designed not to cascade

186
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,890
into ap-southeast-2b, or ap-southeast-2c.

187
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,645
So they're really isolated from disasters.

188
00:06:57,645 --> 00:06:59,760
And then these data centers,

189
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,140
these availability zones,

190
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,730
they are connected with high bandwidth,

191
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,970
ultra low latency networking and therefore

192
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,960
altogether being linked together,

193
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,972
it will form a region.

194
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,150
Okay.

195
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,710
Next to, the only thing we need to know

196
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,630
about AWS for the global infrastructure is the points

197
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,600
of presence or edge locations.

198
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,880
We will see them in details

199
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,850
in the global section of this course,

200
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,120
but you should know that AWS has more than 200 points

201
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,140
of presence in 84 cities across 42 countries.

202
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,470
And this will be very helpful when we deliver content

203
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,440
to the end users with the lowest latency possible.

204
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,900
And this is what you see on this map.

205
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,070
Now again, I'm going quickly

206
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,010
over this because we will see this at the,

207
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,930
about the middle of this course.

208
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,810
So, now how about we just play

209
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,838
around and do a tour of the console.

210
00:07:45,838 --> 00:07:48,980
We'll see that AWS has global services such

211
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,342
as IAM, Route 53, CloudFront, and WAF,

212
00:07:52,342 --> 00:07:53,980
but we'll see that also

213
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,790
most AWS services are going to be regions scoped,

214
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,930
such as Amazon EC2, Elastic Beanstalk,

215
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,050
Lambda, and Rekognition.

216
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,940
Finally, to know if a service is available in your region,

217
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,673
there is a region table you should check out right here.
