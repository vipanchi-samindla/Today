00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,330
Welcome to the first section of this course

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,400
in which I will introduce you the Cloud

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,830
and the Cloud Computing.

4
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:07,800
So this section is not going to be hands-on,

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,470
it's just some theory and some slight,

6
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,120
but hopefully it will put some context into

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,900
why the Cloud is useful and how it works.

8
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,060
So let's go back to the very basics.

9
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,630
How do websites work?

10
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,120
Well we have a server hosted somewhere,

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,930
and we, as a web browser,

12
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,110
want to get access to that server to visualize a websites.

13
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,520
What we are going to do as a client is use a network.

14
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,780
A network between ourselves and the server,

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,660
and the client will find the network and will use network

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,570
to route the packets, the data into the server,

17
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,470
then the server will reply to us,

18
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,550
and we will get the response, and we can view a website.

19
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,100
Obviously that is very simplified,

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,630
but that gives you an idea.

21
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,600
Now for the clients to find the server

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,510
and the server to find the clients,

23
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,860
you need to have IP addresses.

24
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,250
So a clients have IP addresses

25
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,280
and a server also have an IP address.

26
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,950
And so the idea is that when you use an IP address,

27
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,690
you can send a request to wherever you want

28
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,040
to the server you want,

29
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,310
and the server can know how to find you back.

30
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,920
This is very similar to when you are

31
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,930
writing some letters to your friend.

32
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,790
For example, you would write a letter,

33
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,050
and that would be your data, and you would be the client,

34
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,050
then when you send the letter you put it in your mailbox,

35
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,720
and then the network will be the network of the post office,

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,430
then the post office will use network

37
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,810
and the address you put on the letter

38
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,430
to route your letter to the destination,

39
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,460
which is, in this case, the server,

40
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,580
and then if your correspondent wants to reply you back,

41
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,670
they can use the address you put on the back of the envelope

42
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,180
to write you back, and again,

43
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,910
use the same network to get the letter back to you.

44
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,850
So servers are just like the network of your mail.

45
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,360
Hopefully that's a good analogy.

46
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,710
So what is in a server?

47
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,840
Well a server is going to contain a CPU,

48
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,600
and a CPU is a little piece

49
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,910
that will be doing some computations,

50
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,170
it will be very helpful

51
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,660
to do some calculations and find results,

52
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,510
and then, your server also needs RAM, or memory.

53
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,810
This is going to be very, very fast memory,

54
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,200
which will allow us to store information

55
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,930
and retrieve it very quickly.

56
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,930
So when we have a CPU and a memory bar, what do we get?

57
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,810
Well we get a brain.

58
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,180
Think of your brain.

59
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,170
When you are thinking, you are actually making computations,

60
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,640
very complicated ones, but they are computations,

61
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,040
but then you need to retain some information,

62
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,220
and again, we have memories

63
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,420
and these memories are in our brain,

64
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,090
so if we think of the CPU and the RAM together,

65
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,350
they sort of look like a brain.

66
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,730
Now we also need to have

67
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,270
some more long-term storage of data.

68
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,380
Obviously it's still in our brain as humans,

69
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,470
but in computers, we have included

70
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,420
some special storage to store data, for example, files,

71
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,440
and then if we want to store the data

72
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,517
in a more structured way, we're going to use a database,

73
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:08,080
and a database is going to be data formatted in a way

74
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,780
that we can easily search it and query it.

75
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,070
Finally in the server,

76
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,300
we're also going to have some networking aspect.

77
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,770
So there's going to be the routers, switch, DNS servers,

78
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,280
and don't worry, all these terms,

79
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,840
we'll be seeing them later on in this course.

80
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,140
So in the server, we an aspect of compute, memory, storage,

81
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,300
maybe your server sometimes is a database,

82
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,260
and we have a networking aspect.

83
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,670
All these things are gonna super important going forward

84
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,340
because the cloud is going to be giving these things

85
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,390
for us on demand.

86
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,160
So if we just want to define

87
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,830
a little bit of IT terminology before we get started,

88
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,260
the network is a bunch of cables, routers, and servers

89
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,720
that are going to be connected with each other,

90
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,160
and the router is a specific device

91
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,970
that will forward the data packets

92
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,940
between computer in the networks, and they will know

93
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,980
where to send your packets on the internet,

94
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,120
just like your post delivery service.

95
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,720
Now when we have a packet and it arrives as a destination,

96
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,800
there's a switch, and the switch

97
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,700
will send the packet to the correct clients on your network.

98
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,610
So if we put all these things together, it looks like this.

99
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,450
Our client will send the data to a router,

100
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,640
the router will find it's way all the way to a switch,

101
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,010
and the switch will know to which computer

102
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,810
in your network to send the data to.

103
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,270
So why do I introduce all these things?

104
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,100
Well, let's go back to traditional IT.

105
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,990
When people used to start websites or companies before,

106
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,270
they used to do it in their home or their garage,

107
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,780
and so they would literally go to the store,

108
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,130
buy a server, and they put the server in their home.

109
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,230
You may have seen TV shows,

110
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,230
you may have read some documentation on the internet

111
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,150
that describes on how Google was made.

112
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,550
You know, Google was started in a garage.

113
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,540
Now, as your website grows, you need to add

114
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,840
more and more servers to serve that demand,

115
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,810
and so your home starts to be filled with servers.

116
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,070
So this bad right, but your company is getting bigger,

117
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,450
you're generating some money,

118
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,010
so you're going to move to your own office,

119
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,890
and you decide to allocate a special room

120
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,740
which is going to be called a data center.

121
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,840
In a data center, you're going to have, again, your servers,

122
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,450
and you're going to be able to scale them

123
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,690
by adding and purchasing more and more servers.

124
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,470
Now this worked, and this worked for so many years,

125
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,470
but there are a few problems with this approach.

126
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,760
Number one is that when you have a data center

127
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,710
or your own home, you're going to have to pay your rent,

128
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,400
then you're going to have to add power supply,

129
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,820
cooling, and maintenance

130
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,670
because it does require some electricity

131
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,500
to run your servers, it does require some cooling

132
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,090
because the servers do get hot,

133
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,530
and sometimes they break down,

134
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,390
so you need someone to do the maintenance.

135
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:48,120
On top of it, if you want to add or replace servers,

136
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,830
it will take a lot of time because you have to order them,

137
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,560
and then you have to hook them up in your center.

138
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,010
Scaling is limited.

139
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,140
If tomorrow you're getting 10 times bigger,

140
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,350
you're going to need 10 times more servers,

141
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,680
but you may not have the time or the space to do so.

142
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,940
You also need to hire a team

143
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,710
that is going to be there all the time,

144
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,100
24/7 to monitor the infrastructure

145
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,750
in case something goes wrong.

146
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,510
And what if there is a disaster,

147
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,210
what if there is an earthquake,

148
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,070
what if there's a power shutdown, or even a fire?

149
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,430
That would be bad, right?

150
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,500
So can we externalize all this?

151
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,160
And the answer is yes, and that will be the cloud.

152
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,830
So I will see you in the next lecture

153
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,080
to discuss a little bit more about the cloud.
