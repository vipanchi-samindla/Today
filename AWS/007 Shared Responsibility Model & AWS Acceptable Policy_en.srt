1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,900
Now, one last touch before get started

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:02,740
with this course.

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,140
I will be referring to

4
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,600
the Shared Responsibility Model quite a lot.

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,200
And you will see this diagram at the end of this course.

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,150
This is what define what is your responsibility

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,670
versus AWS when using the cloud

8
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,890
and there is a shared responsibility.

9
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,090
You as a customer, you're responsible

10
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,120
for the security in the cloud.

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,200
So whatever you use in the cloud,

12
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,490
however you configure it is your entire responsibility.

13
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,600
That includes security, your data, your operating system,

14
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,560
your network and firewall configuration, et cetera.

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,960
And AWS is going to be responsible

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,100
for the security of the cloud.

17
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,940
So all the infrastructure, all the hardware,

18
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,180
all the software, all their own internal security,

19
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,550
they are responsible of.

20
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,400
And this is why we have shared responsibility.

21
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,250
In the Certified Cloud Practitioner exam,

22
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,540
you will be asked some questions around finding

23
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,840
what is your responsibility

24
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,430
and what is the responsibility of AWS.

25
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,930
So I just wanted to give you a quick overview of this

26
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,080
and in some sections I will be referring back

27
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,410
to this diagram and this model to tell you

28
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,010
what is your responsibility

29
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,267
and what is the responsibility of AWS.

30
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,150
Finally, when you use AWS,

31
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,340
you are agreeing to their Acceptable Use Policy,

32
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,640
which you can find right here

33
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,960
and I think it's pretty obvious

34
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,320
that you cannot do any illegal,

35
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,080
harmful of offensive use or content,

36
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,360
you cannot do any security violation,

37
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,190
you cannot abuse a network

38
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,720
and you cannot do email or other types of messages abuse.

39
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,390
All of that makes sense but it's good to specify it.

40
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,510
Now , I hope you're excited.

41
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,270
We're gonna get started with this course

42
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,150
and actually get to use the cloud.

43
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,100
So, I will see you in the next section.
